oligo tm
--------------------------

[This shiny app](https://dsurujon.shinyapps.io/primer-tm/) calculates the melting temperatures(Tm) of a pair of DNA sequences or oligonucleotides. The Tm is defined as the temperature at which 50% of the oligonucleotides will be dissociated from their complementary strand. This information can be applied when designing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. Enter two dna sequences (strings only containing the characters a,c,t,g,A,C,T,G) in the Oligo input fields on the left and hit calculate to generate their corresponding Tm's. 
The calculation is based on the description in [this webpage by promega ](https://www.promega.com/techserv/tools/biomath/calc11.htm#disc).
